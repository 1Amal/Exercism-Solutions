NPM commands
Execute the tests with: npm run test

Be sure your code follows best practices and coding styles, as other users do, with ESLint, a tool to perform static analysis on your code. Sometimes, tools like this save you some time detecting typos or silly mistakes in your JavaScript code: npm run lint

You can also run Jest in "watch" mode, which will re-run your tests automatically when you save changes to the code or test module: npm run watch
